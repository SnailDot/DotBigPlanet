# DotBigPlanet
A tool to help you customize Little Big Planet VITA + PSP to your liking

*Made for Windows 11 java*

The goal of this program is make the entire proccess of getting into LBP, downloading content for it, and anything else you could wish to do with the games as easy as a few button clicks regardless of what game or platform you are playing on. This program while rough around the edges, is my love letter to Little big planet. I got tired of always having to hunt things down to install across the internet each time I got back into the game, and I'm only able to do that because I know where to look and how to install everything, but not everyone does, which is what I hope this program will fix.

# OVER ALL FEATURES (For All LBP Games other than karting)
- Option to auto find your save folder for your LBP if you dont know where it is
