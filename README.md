# DotBigPlanet
A tool to unlock/change Little Big Planet to your liking, regardless of your technical knowledge on the subject.

*Made for Windows 11 java*

The goal of this program is make the entire proccess of getting into LBP, downloading content for it, and anything else you could wish to do with the games as easy as a few button clicks regardless of what game or platform you are playing on. This program while rough around the edges, is my love letter to Little big planet. I got tired of always having to hunt things down to install across the internet each time I got back into the game, and I'm only able to do that because I know where to look and how to install everything, but not everyone does, which is what I hope this program will fix.

# IMPORTANT INFO
- DotBigPlanet's ability to read profile infomation like profile name, moon names, and community level names is directly powered by toolkit which is another LBP save editor/viewer tool.
- All Community save files are from the Little Big Planet Archive, while all Fresh + DBP Save files are made by me.
- All save files and levels are bundled into the program, so that way it can work without internet

- The UI doesnt look the best as im trying to focus on making the program first, then I can go in and color in everything perfectly.
- *I love the vita more than anything else, so thats always gonna get the most care as ive learned more about it compared to the PS3/PS4/PSP.*
