# DotBigPlanet
A tool to help you customize Little Big Planet VITA + PSP to your liking

*Made for Windows 11 java*

This program while rough around the edges, is my love letter to Little big planet. I got tired of always having to hunt things down across the internet each time I got back into the game, and I'm only able to do that because I know where to look and how to install everything, but not everyone does, which is what I hope this program will fix
